STM32 Camera Driver PCB
This project is a custom-designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that integrates an STM32H7 microcontroller, a camera module, a display, five buttons, and multiple communication ports.

Features
The key features of this project are:

STM32H7 Microcontroller: The STM32H7 is a powerful 32-bit microcontroller with a dual-core ARM Cortex-M7 and Cortex-M4 processor, capable of running at up to 480 MHz. It offers a wide range of peripherals and connectivity options, making it ideal for embedded systems applications.

Camera Module: The camera module used in this project is a high-resolution OV5640 sensor that captures 5-megapixel still images and 720p video at 60 frames per second.

Display: The display used in this project is a 1.8-inch TFT LCD screen with a resolution of 320x240 pixels. It provides a clear and bright display for viewing images and video captured by the camera.

Five Buttons: The board includes five buttons for user input, allowing users to control the camera and interact with the user interface displayed on the screen.

Communication Ports: The board includes multiple communication ports, including USB, UART, SPI, and I2C, providing flexibility for communicating with other devices and systems.

Repository Contents
This repository contains the design files for the PCB, including the schematic, PCB layout, and bill of materials. The KiCad project files are provided, as well as PDFs of the schematic and PCB layout for easy viewing.

Getting Started
To use this PCB, you will need to assemble and program it. The bill of materials provides a list of components needed, and the KiCad project files can be used to generate the Gerber files needed to manufacture the PCB.

Once the PCB is assembled, you can use the provided example code to get started. The code includes basic functionality for capturing images and video, displaying them on the screen, and interacting with the user through the buttons.
